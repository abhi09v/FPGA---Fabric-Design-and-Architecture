# FPGA - Fabric, Design and Architecture
  This repository contains all the information studied and created during the workshop. It is primarily focused on a complete FPGA flow using the maximum open-source tools 
  
  

# Day 1 - FPGA Basics and Vivado
 ## FPGA Architecture
   The FPGA Architecture primarily consists of :
    - Configurable Logic Blocks(CLBs)
    - Programmable Interconnects 
    - I/O Cells
    - Memory / Block RAM
